Hey there!

Today we will be learning the basics of Rust. Rust is a multi-paradigm (not comparable)programming language designed for performance and safety, 
and safe concurrency. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but can guarantee memory safety.

Today I will guide you how to set up a Rust environment. Most debian based O.S such as Linux have the Rust compiler otherwise 
known as rustc.To confirm wherether you have it,open a terminal instance and type **#rustc**

If unavailable on your system type:

**# sudo apt-get install curl -y**

Once Curl has been installed

**# curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh**

For windows users here is a link to a guide to set up a Rust development environment
